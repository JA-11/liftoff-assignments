## Submission Instructions

### Overview
It can be overwhelming to find a movie to watch these days with many different streaming services offering countless options to choose from.  Our project is a movie finder application.  The idea is that a user will create an account, select the streaming service(s) they have access to, search for movies to watch based on their individual preferences (genre, rating, etc.), and then save those movies as a “to-watch” list in their profile.

Our project will be useful to everyone who loves movies, especially for those who spend hours scrolling through apps trying to find something to watch.  The application will help users keep everything in one place and cut down on wasted search time.  Whenever a user is interested in watching something, they can log into their account and quickly pick a movie from their personalized list.

### Features
•	Secure user login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application.
•	Profile Management: Each user will have the ability to set up their own profile page.
•	Search: Users will be able to search for movies to watch by selecting their available streaming services and inputting personal preferences (genre, rating, etc.).
•	Watch list: Users will create a “to-watch” list on their profile.  Each user can add movies to and delete movies from their list.
•	Mobile responsive: Users can access the application from devices with small and large screens.  The layout/content will adjust based on screen size.
